# MulleFoundation

This is the Foundation library written for [mulle-objc](//mulle-objc.github.io).

*MulleFoundation* is growing collection of libraries to form a complete and powerful Objective-C
class library for *mulle-objc*. An Objective-C Foundation traditionally contains no graphics code.

The *MulleFoundation* is designed as plug and play system. Optional library components can be 
left out with no bad side-effect. The concept of the *MulleFoundation* is to avoid actual 
linking into a shared library or executable as much as possible. This has the benefit that
an optimizing pass can determine, which parts need to be actually linked and which not.

Library                                                                                | Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------
[Foundation](//github.com/MulleFoundation/Foundation-startup)                          | Startup code for Foundation-based executables
[MulleFoundation](//github.com/MulleFoundation/MulleFoundation-startup)                | Startup code for MulleFoundation-based executables

*MulleFoundation* is based on [MulleObjC](//MulleObjC.github.io) and [mulle-core](//mulle-core.github.io).
Some constituent libraries bring in outside depedencies such as *expat* for XML parsing.
